# DFRL-Base-Station-Sleep-Control
The presented code is the implementation of the framework proposed in paper entitled as "Decentralized Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Energy" for the 11th International Symposium on Telecommunication (IST 2024). The presented framework leverages the power of the decentralized federated deep reinforcement learning approach to optimize the energy saving in 5G network base stations(BSs), while maintaining the quality of service and minimizing the total cost of these stations.

## Dataset
The evaluations are conducted on the TelecomItalia dataset[[1]](#1) which can be accessed through [IEEE DataPort](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/telecom-italia-and-opnet-datasets-network-traffic-prediction). As the data is not publically available, we are unable to share it here; Hence, please refer to IEEE DataPort to obtain this dataset.
As it is described on IEEE DataPort:
> Telecom Italia: As part of the “Big Data Challenge”, consists of data about telecommunication activity in the city of Milan and in the province of Trentino. Data collectors divide Milan into 100×100 regions, and all traffic data statistics are based on regions. The total volume of SMS, call, and internet traffic sent and received by users in each area is collected every 10 minutes. We sample the internet traffic data during the period from 22:00 10/31/2013 to 22:50 12/19/2013 with a cell area size of 15×15.
